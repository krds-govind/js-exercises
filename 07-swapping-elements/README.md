# Swapping Elements

- There're are two entities `Stock` and `Cart`
- By clicking an element one can move 1 unit of the element
- If no units available, remove it from entity
- Update total units count in `Cart` header
- `Clear Cart` should clear the cart & update the counts
- Data should be persistent. i.e refresh should load previous data
